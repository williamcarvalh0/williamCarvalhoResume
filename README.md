** Initial Ideias**
since the beginning I Wanted to create a simple web site showing who I am and what I do, however, I thought about including a few animations which would be nice for the site and also showing a little bit more of who I am as a person.

## Problems occurred/solutions

1 - nav bar was not responsive / I went to w3school and saw a few examples how to do it and solved it.
2 - when you select some text in the browsers it is highlighted normally in blue color. / disable this highlighting with the CSS
3 - in mobible view on myself page the text of the image background appers / I did not find any solution for that.
